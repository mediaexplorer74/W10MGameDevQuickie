# GeoWar - Neon branch ("NeonShooter" v1.0.14.0)
![](Images/logo.png)

## About
This is my *veeery quuuick* W10M port of [Nixxs's GeoWar](https://github.com/Nixxs/GeoWar) project. 
I mixed it with MonoGame NeonShooter game sample :)

Main goal: do some testing/exploration of new "native" (not mine/not tweaked) MonoGame.Framework.WindowsUniversal (v3.7.xx or v3.8.xx) package !

## Status of my GeoWar porting
- Main W10M device : Lumia 950; sdk 15063+ (Last) - all ok and touchscreen reacted .. but no screen rescaling realized yet.
- Secondary W10M device : sdk 10240 (Astoria) - all ok but touchscreen not reacted (very strange... possible reason: not tweaked MonoGame.Framework.WindowsUniversal package!).
- Game sounds - fixed (some support of cool fx effects discovered...).
- Background music theme -- fixed!
- Game speed encreazed to better sync with music theme:)
- Original kbd control still presend for desktop mode. 
- Fullscreen mode not distorted "header"/"footer" -- so interesting :)
- Screen autosizing fixed (Game "autoscale" mode activated ))
