## About 
This is my experiment to run some simplest Desktop Monogame2D apps on/in W10M Astoria OS!:)

## Screenshots (Target: win 11 on desktop pc)

## Features
Min. Win. OS Build descreased to 10240 (Astoria Compatibility)

## Progress
- Q01-Q21 ported to UWP, but a lite incomplete (because of no TouchPanel "handlers" yet)
- P01 and P02 ported to UWP too (keyboard/mouse control only at now... no touch, heh!)

## Bugs / Errors
- SpriteFont mulfunction 
- Strange scene scaling (some error still here)
- Pixel Shaders (fx) incompatibility
- Map pathfinding seems to be broken ;(

## Requirements
